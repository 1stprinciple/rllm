# rLLM: Reinforcement Learning for Language Agents

rLLM is a library for training and deploying LLM agents using reinforcement learning. It provides a comprehensive framework to create, train, and evaluate LLM-based agents across a variety of tasks and environments.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Easily create custom agents and environments.
- **Multi-domain Support**: Train agents for math, code, web browsing, and more.
- **Flexible Reward Systems**: Define custom reward functions for diverse tasks.
- **Scalable Training**: Distributed training with efficient rollout engines. 
- **Advanced Tool Usage**: Enable LLMs to use tools and external APIs.
- **Evaluation Framework**: Robust evaluation pipelines to measure agent performance.

## Why rLLM?
