How can each person move to the next pier in a clockwise direction, given that movement is only allowed on the lake?\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Problem Setup**:\n",
      "    - We have 5 docks arranged in a circle around a lake.\n",
      "    - At each dock, there is one person.\n",
      "    - One dock has a one-person boat.\n",
      "    - People at neighboring docks are in conflict and want to avoid meeting each other.\n",

      "    - Movement is only possible over the lake.\n",
      "\n",

      "3. **First Step**:\n",
      "    - Move in the opposite direction of the desired final movement (i.e., counter-clockwise), forming a specific shifting pattern.\n",
      "    - Perform the following moves:\n",
      "        - Person at dock 1 takes the boat and moves to dock 4.\n",
      "        - Person at dock 4 takes the boat and moves to dock 2.\n",
      "        - Person at dock 2 takes the boat and moves to dock 5.\n",

      "5. **Second Step**:\n",
      "    - Now, each person moves clockwise to their desired neighbor, as there is no conflict in the current setup.\n",
      "    - Perform the moves:\n",
      "        - Person at dock 3 moves to dock 4.\n",
      "        - Person at dock 1 moves to dock 2.\n",
      "        - Person at dock 4 moves to dock 5.\n",
      "        - Person at dock 2 moves to dock 3.\n",
      "        - Person at dock 5 moves to dock 1.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    These can be summarized as:\n",
      "    \\[\n",
      "    3 \\rightarrow 4, \\quad 1 \\rightarrow 2, \\quad 4 \\rightarrow 5, \\quad 2 \\rightarrow 3, \\quad 5 \\rightarrow 1\n",
      "    \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Final Configuration**:\n",
      "\n",
      "    - After the second set of moves, everyone will be at their desired dock:\n",
      "        - Dock 1: Person who started at dock 5\n",

      "        - Dock 3: Person who started at dock 2\n",
