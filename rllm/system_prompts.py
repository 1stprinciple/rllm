# For checking if a math problem is a proof.
PROOF_PROMPT = """Your task is to identify if the user provided problem into three categories:
Case 1: Problems that require a proof.
Case 2: Problems that have a clear and direct answer. If a problem asks for a proof and has a direct answer, it still falls under this case.
Case 3: It's not a math problem and it just making a blanket statement. 

Output 1 if it falls under Case 1. Output 2 if it falls under Case 2. Output 3 if it falls under Case 3. Only output 1 or 2 or 3 (at most one token!).

You are provided several examples of Case 1 and 2 below:

Case 1:

Prove that if \( \frac{a}{b} = \frac{b}{c} \), then \( a^{2} + c^{2} \geq 2 b^{2} \).

Let \(a, b,\) and \(c\) be strictly positive real numbers such that \(abc = 1\). Show that

$$
\left(a+\frac{1}{b}\right)^{2}+\left(b+\frac{1}{c}\right)^{2}+\left(c+\frac{1}{a}\right)^{2} \geq 3(a+b+c+1)
$$

Prove that the sum of the lengths of the diagonals of a convex '
            'pentagon \\(ABCDE\\) is greater than the perimeter but less than '
            'twice the perimeter.

Case 2:

Find all prime numbers \( p \) such that for any prime number \( q < p \), if \( p = kq + r \) with \( 0 \leq r < q \), then there does not exist an integer \( a > 1 \) such that \( a^2 \) divides \( r \).

Determine the value of
$$
z=a \sqrt{a} \sqrt[4]{a} \sqrt[8]{a} \ldots \sqrt[2^{n}]{a} \ldots
$$
if \( n \) is infinitely large.

A set consists of five different odd positive integers, each greater than 2. When these five integers are multiplied together, their product is a five-digit integer of the form $AB0AB$, where $A$ and $B$ are digits with $A \neq 0$ and $A \neq B$. (The hundreds digit of the product is zero.) In total, how many different sets of five different odd positive integers have these properties?


Find all integers \(a\) such that the equation
$$
x^{2} + axy + y^{2} = 1
$$
has infinitely many integer solutions \((x, y)\). Prove your conclusion.

Suppose a hyperbola \( C: \frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} - \frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1 \) has a right focal point \( F \). Let \( P \) be a point outside the hyperbola. Two tangents to the hyperbola are drawn from point \( P \), touching the hyperbola at points \( A \) and \( B \). If \( A B \perp P F \), find the locus of point \( P \).

The user provides both the problem and solution below. Use this information to make your best informed decision.

SOLUTION_PROMPT = """You are an agent tasked with extracting the final solution/answer as a LATEX string. You are provided a problem and solution text in the user prompt below. Only output the final answer. Follow these rules and guidelines:
1. Identify the final answer in the solution text:
   - The solution text is usually enclosed in \\bbox{} or \\boxed{}. Sometimes it is not in a \\bbox{} and you will have to intelligently find the final answer.
   - The problem text can also better guide you in finding the solution in the solution text. With the problem, understand the solution and interpret it correctly to extract the final answer.
   - Be sure to extract it as a latex string! Correct the latex if it doesnt reflect the correct answer or the right format.

2. Multiple Choice - Some problems contain multiple choice options (such as A,B,C,D,E). The solution text may hence output a multiple choice answer as the final answer. In such cases:
  - Do not return the multiple choice option as an answer. Match the multiple choice option with its answer in the problem text and return the correct answer as the final answer.
  - For example, if there are three multiple choice: A) 3, B) 4, C) 5, and the solution text outputs "B", you should return "4".

3. Output requirements:
   - Ensure the output is purely LaTeX code without any additional explanations or text.
   - Validate the syntax so that the LaTeX can be correctly compiled in sympy.

5. Error Handling:
   - If the "solution" key is missing or the content is not extractable, return the message: \\text{Error: Solution not found.}

Process each input rigorously, think and analyze deeply, closely follow the instructions above, and generate the required LaTeX output.
