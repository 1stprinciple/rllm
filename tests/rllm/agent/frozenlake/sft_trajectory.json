But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer.

P is not actually on G yet because they are not overlapping, it needs reach G to its left. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample5:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   _   _\nO   _   O   O   O\nO   _   O   G   _\nO   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet.

Move up and left means I can still reach G. Move up will result in 9 steps in total while left is 7 steps. I need to move left.

I can move right or down but there is a hole in down position and I can not move diagonally. There is no hole in my next movement right so I can move to right. Action: ```Right```\n\nExample2:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   _\n_   _   _   O\n_   O   _   P\nO   _   _   G\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: P is now at the near G. It should reach G to its bottom. I should move to be on it. There is no hole in my next movement so I can move to down. Action: ```Down```\n\nExample3:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   O   _\nO   _   O   _   _\nO   _   _   G   _\n_   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right relative to P. I want to move closer so I should move right or down. But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample4:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   _\n_   _   _   O\n_   O   _   O\nO   G   P   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: P is now near G. But game has not finished. P is not at G and I should never output invalid action. I need to recheck my understanding. P is not actually on G yet because they are not overlapping, it needs reach G to its left. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample5:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   _   _\nO   _   O   O   O\nO   _   O   G   _\nO   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right corner of P. I can move left, right, or up. Move right will initially bring me closer but I can't reach G that way. Move up and left means I can still reach G. Move up will result in 9 steps in total while left is 7 steps. I need to move left. Action: ```Left```\n\nNow it is your turn, please show your thinking process and put the final action in ``` ```.

I can move right or down but there is a hole in down position and I can not move diagonally. There is no hole in my next movement right so I can move to right.

But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample4:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   _\n_   _   _   O\n_   O   _   O\nO   G   P   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet.

Frozen tiles are slippery, you may move perpendicular to your intended direction.\n\nValid Action (separated by | ):\nUp | Down | Left | Right\n\nRewards:\nFall into hole: 0\nReach goal: +1.0\n\nYou will be provided the current observation, please decide on the next Action.\nYou should show your thought process and then input the final action in ``` ```.\nYou should only output the NEXT ACTION at each interation in the ``` ```.\nYou should plan ahead and try to achieve it in minimum number of steps.\n\nBelow are examples for an interaction:\nExample1:\nUser: Current Observation:\nP   _   _   _   _\nO   _   _   O   _\nO   _   O   _   _\nO   _   _   G   _\n_   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet.

I can move right or down but there is a hole in down position and I can not move diagonally. There is no hole in my next movement right so I can move to right. Action: ```Right```\n\nExample2:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   _\n_   _   _   O\n_   O   _   P\nO   _   _   G\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet.

Action: ```Down```\n\nExample3:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   O   _\nO   _   O   _   _\nO   _   _   G   _\n_   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet.

But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer.

Move up and left means I can still reach G. Move up will result in 9 steps in total while left is 7 steps. I need to move left.

Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right relative to P. I want to move closer so I should move right or down. But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer.

Frozen tiles are slippery, you may move perpendicular to your intended direction.\n\nValid Action (separated by | ):\nUp | Down | Left | Right\n\nRewards:\nFall into hole: 0\nReach goal: +1.0\n\nYou will be provided the current observation, please decide on the next Action.\nYou should show your thought process and then input the final action in ``` ```.\nYou should only output the NEXT ACTION at each interation in the ``` ```.\nYou should plan ahead and try to achieve it in minimum number of steps.\n\nBelow are examples for an interaction:\nExample1:\nUser: Current Observation:\nP   _   _   _   _\nO   _   _   O   _\nO   _   O   _   _\nO   _   _   G   _\n_   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet.

I can move right or down but there is a hole in down position and I can not move diagonally. There is no hole in my next movement right so I can move to right. Action: ```Right```\n\nExample2:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   _\n_   _   _   O\n_   O   _   P\nO   _   _   G\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet.

Action: ```Down```\n\nExample3:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   O   _\nO   _   O   _   _\nO   _   _   G   _\n_   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right relative to P. I want to move closer so I should move right or down. But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample4:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   _\n_   _   _   O\n_   O   _   O\nO   G   P   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: P is now near G. But game has not finished. P is not at G and I should never output invalid action. I need to recheck my understanding. P is not actually on G yet because they are not overlapping, it needs reach G to its left. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample5:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   _   _\nO   _   O   O   O\nO   _   O   G   _\nO   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right corner of P. I can move left, right, or up. Move right will initially bring me closer but I can't reach G that way. Move up and left means I can still reach G. Move up will result in 9 steps in total while left is 7 steps. I need to move left. Action: ```Left```\n\nNow it is your turn, please show your thinking process and put the final action in ``` ```.

Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: P is now at the top right corner. It should reach G at the bottom right corner. I should move it closer to it. I can move right or down but there is a hole in down position and I can not move diagonally. There is no hole in my next movement right so I can move to right. Action: ```Right```\n\nExample2:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   _\n_   _   _   O\n_   O   _   P\nO   _   _   G\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: P is now at the near G. It should reach G to its bottom. I should move to be on it. There is no hole in my next movement so I can move to down. Action: ```Down```\n\nExample3:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   O   _\nO   _   O   _   _\nO   _   _   G   _\n_   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right relative to P. I want to move closer so I should move right or down. But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample4:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   _\n_   _   _   O\n_   O   _   O\nO   G   P   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: P is now near G. But game has not finished. P is not at G and I should never output invalid action. I need to recheck my understanding. P is not actually on G yet because they are not overlapping, it needs reach G to its left. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample5:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   _   _\nO   _   O   O   O\nO   _   O   G   _\nO   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right corner of P. I can move left, right, or up. Move right will initially bring me closer but I can't reach G that way. Move up and left means I can still reach G. Move up will result in 9 steps in total while left is 7 steps. I need to move left.

But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer.

I can move right or down but there is a hole in down position and I can not move diagonally. There is no hole in my next movement right so I can move to right.

Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right relative to P. I want to move closer so I should move right or down. But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample4:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   _\n_   _   _   O\n_   O   _   O\nO   G   P   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: P is now near G. But game has not finished. P is not at G and I should never output invalid action. I need to recheck my understanding. P is not actually on G yet because they are not overlapping, it needs reach G to its left. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample5:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   _   _\nO   _   O   O   O\nO   _   O   G   _\nO   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right corner of P. I can move left, right, or up. Move right will initially bring me closer but I can't reach G that way. Move up and left means I can still reach G. Move up will result in 9 steps in total while left is 7 steps. I need to move left. Action: ```Left```\n\nNow it is your turn, please show your thinking process and put the final action in ``` ```.

I can move right or down but there is a hole in down position and I can not move diagonally. There is no hole in my next movement right so I can move to right.

Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right relative to P. I want to move closer so I should move right or down. But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample4:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   _\n_   _   _   O\n_   O   _   O\nO   G   P   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: P is now near G. But game has not finished. P is not at G and I should never output invalid action. I need to recheck my understanding. P is not actually on G yet because they are not overlapping, it needs reach G to its left. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample5:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   _   _\nO   _   O   O   O\nO   _   O   G   _\nO   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right corner of P. I can move left, right, or up. Move right will initially bring me closer but I can't reach G that way. Move up and left means I can still reach G. Move up will result in 9 steps in total while left is 7 steps. I need to move left.

But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer.

P is not actually on G yet because they are not overlapping, it needs reach G to its left. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample5:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   _   _\nO   _   O   O   O\nO   _   O   G   _\nO   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right corner of P. I can move left, right, or up. Move right will initially bring me closer but I can't reach G that way. Move up and left means I can still reach G. Move up will result in 9 steps in total while left is 7 steps. I need to move left.

P is not actually on G yet because they are not overlapping, it needs reach G to its left.

P is not actually on G yet because they are not overlapping, it needs reach G to its left. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample5:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   _   _\nO   _   O   O   O\nO   _   O   G   _\nO   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right corner of P. I can move left, right, or up. Move right will initially bring me closer but I can't reach G that way. Move up and left means I can still reach G. Move up will result in 9 steps in total while left is 7 steps. I need to move left.

Frozen tiles are slippery, you may move perpendicular to your intended direction.\n\nValid Action (separated by | ):\nUp | Down | Left | Right\n\nRewards:\nFall into hole: 0\nReach goal: +1.0\n\nYou will be provided the current observation, please decide on the next Action.\nYou should show your thought process and then input the final action in ``` ```.\nYou should only output the NEXT ACTION at each interation in the ``` ```.\nYou should plan ahead and try to achieve it in minimum number of steps.\n\nBelow are examples for an interaction:\nExample1:\nUser: Current Observation:\nP   _   _   _   _\nO   _   _   O   _\nO   _   O   _   _\nO   _   _   G   _\n_   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: P is now at the top right corner. It should reach G at the bottom right corner. I should move it closer to it. I can move right or down but there is a hole in down position and I can not move diagonally. There is no hole in my next movement right so I can move to right. Action: ```Right```\n\nExample2:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   _\n_   _   _   O\n_   O   _   P\nO   _   _   G\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet.

Action: ```Down```\n\nExample3:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   O   _\nO   _   O   _   _\nO   _   _   G   _\n_   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right relative to P. I want to move closer so I should move right or down. But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample4:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   _\n_   _   _   O\n_   O   _   O\nO   G   P   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: P is now near G. But game has not finished. P is not at G and I should never output invalid action. I need to recheck my understanding. P is not actually on G yet because they are not overlapping, it needs reach G to its left. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample5:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   _   _\nO   _   O   O   O\nO   _   O   G   _\nO   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right corner of P. I can move left, right, or up. Move right will initially bring me closer but I can't reach G that way. Move up and left means I can still reach G. Move up will result in 9 steps in total while left is 7 steps. I need to move left. Action: ```Left```\n\nNow it is your turn, please show your thinking process and put the final action in ``` ```.

But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer.

P is not actually on G yet because they are not overlapping, it needs reach G to its left. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample5:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   _   _\nO   _   O   O   O\nO   _   O   G   _\nO   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet.

Move up and left means I can still reach G. Move up will result in 9 steps in total while left is 7 steps. I need to move left.

However, a direct 'Down' action from the current position will most likely result in a fall into the hole because there is a high risk of accidentally moving left or right due to the slippery tiles - this is a dangerous move.\n\n'Left' and 'Right' actions are also risky because to the left there is a hole and to the right, further movement will also likely lead to a hole.\n\nA 'Right' move initially seems like the most promising action, it takes P two steps towards the right. The immediate surroundings suggest that after the first move, a 'Down' move will be a bit safer because the next tile is either a frozen tile or a hole, but not a transition from a frozen tile to a goal, which is tricky to navigate with the slippery tiles.\n\nThe best initial action therefore is: ```Right```"

Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: P is now at the near G. It should reach G to its bottom. I should move to be on it. There is no hole in my next movement so I can move to down. Action: ```Down```\n\nExample3:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   O   _\nO   _   O   _   _\nO   _   _   G   _\n_   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right relative to P. I want to move closer so I should move right or down. But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample4:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   _\n_   _   _   O\n_   O   _   O\nO   G   P   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: P is now near G. But game has not finished. P is not at G and I should never output invalid action. I need to recheck my understanding. P is not actually on G yet because they are not overlapping, it needs reach G to its left. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample5:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   _   _\nO   _   O   O   O\nO   _   O   G   _\nO   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right corner of P. I can move left, right, or up. Move right will initially bring me closer but I can't reach G that way. Move up and left means I can still reach G. Move up will result in 9 steps in total while left is 7 steps. I need to move left. Action: ```Left```\n\nNow it is your turn, please show your thinking process and put the final action in ``` ```. In every turn, the final action MUST be one of Up, Down, Left, Right.\nCurrent Observation: \n _ \t _ \t _ \t G \t _ \t _ \t\n _ \t _ \t _ \t _ \t _ \t O \t\n _ \t _ \t _ \t O \t O \t O \t\n P \t _ \t O \t O \t _ \t O \t\n O \t _ \t _ \t _ \t _ \t _ \t\n O \t _ \t _ \t _ \t _ \t O \t\n You have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet.

Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right relative to P. I want to move closer so I should move right or down. But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample4:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   _\n_   _   _   O\n_   O   _   O\nO   G   P   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: P is now near G. But game has not finished. P is not at G and I should never output invalid action. I need to recheck my understanding. P is not actually on G yet because they are not overlapping, it needs reach G to its left. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample5:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   _   _\nO   _   O   O   O\nO   _   O   G   _\nO   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right corner of P. I can move left, right, or up. Move right will initially bring me closer but I can't reach G that way. Move up and left means I can still reach G. Move up will result in 9 steps in total while left is 7 steps. I need to move left. Action: ```Left```\n\nNow it is your turn, please show your thinking process and put the final action in ``` ```.

Frozen tiles are slippery, you may move perpendicular to your intended direction.\n\nValid Action (separated by | ):\nUp | Down | Left | Right\n\nRewards:\nFall into hole: 0\nReach goal: +1.0\n\nYou will be provided the current observation, please decide on the next Action.\nYou should show your thought process and then input the final action in ``` ```.\nYou should only output the NEXT ACTION at each interation in the ``` ```.\nYou should plan ahead and try to achieve it in minimum number of steps.\n\nBelow are examples for an interaction:\nExample1:\nUser: Current Observation:\nP   _   _   _   _\nO   _   _   O   _\nO   _   O   _   _\nO   _   _   G   _\n_   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: P is now at the top right corner. It should reach G at the bottom right corner. I should move it closer to it. I can move right or down but there is a hole in down position and I can not move diagonally. There is no hole in my next movement right so I can move to right. Action: ```Right```\n\nExample2:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   _\n_   _   _   O\n_   O   _   P\nO   _   _   G\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: P is now at the near G. It should reach G to its bottom. I should move to be on it. There is no hole in my next movement so I can move to down. Action: ```Down```\n\nExample3:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   O   _\nO   _   O   _   _\nO   _   _   G   _\n_   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right relative to P. I want to move closer so I should move right or down. But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample4:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   _\n_   _   _   O\n_   O   _   O\nO   G   P   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: P is now near G. But game has not finished. P is not at G and I should never output invalid action. I need to recheck my understanding. P is not actually on G yet because they are not overlapping, it needs reach G to its left. Action: ```Left```\n\nExample5:\nUser: Current Observation:\n_   _   _   O   _\nO   _   P   _   _\nO   _   O   O   O\nO   _   O   G   _\nO   _   _   _   _\nYou have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet. Please give the next action.\n\nAssistant: G is at the bottom right corner of P. I can move left, right, or up. Move right will initially bring me closer but I can't reach G that way. Move up and left means I can still reach G. Move up will result in 9 steps in total while left is 7 steps. I need to move left. Action: ```Left```\n\nNow it is your turn, please show your thinking process and put the final action in ``` ```. In every turn, the final action MUST be one of Up, Down, Left, Right.\nCurrent Observation: \n _ \t O \t O \t _ \t P \t\n O \t _ \t O \t _ \t _ \t\n _ \t _ \t _ \t _ \t _ \t\n _ \t O \t _ \t _ \t G \t\n O \t _ \t O \t _ \t O \t\n You have not achieved the goal, P has not reached G yet.

But there is a hole at each position and I do not want to fall into holes. Up and left are both valid but left brings me closer.
